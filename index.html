<p style="font-size:48px;">Eliot Burk â€“ Composer, Performer</p>

<p style="font-size:12px;">Eliot Burk is a composer, multi-instrumentalist, performance artist, and music teacher working out of the 
  San Francisco Bay Area. Eliot's music attempts to unify disparate and seemingly paradoxical conceptions: control over the uncontrollable, 
  intentional failure & amateurism against virtuosity & professionalism, fusing the anti-art of Fluxus & Dada with the strictures of 
  high-modernist serialism & spectralism, freedom & rigor, boredom & violence.</p>

<p style="font-size:12px;">Recently he has been investigating how instrumental physicality & 
  performer perception can structure music on every level, from phrase to global form. In Eliot's 
  "Piece for Four Guitars in Scordatura," each instrument is tuned to a different scordatura derived 
  from the overtones of the lowest string on the lowest instrument. Players engage in 36 guided 
  improvisations, giving different lenses through which to reconsider their own instruments 
  in light of the alien tuning in collision with the tuning of fretted notes. In "Surface" 
  for string quartet, the performers trace their bows across the entire wooden surface of 
  their instrument (skipping the strings), revealing the unique resonances, non-resonances, 
  and pseudo-resonances of each portion. The resulting architectonic form becomes a sonic 
  projection of the ensemble's shape. "Lengths of Finger & Fingerboard," also for string quartet, 
  is strictly constructed out of the performers' perceptions of resonance lengths of pizzicati.</p>

<p style="font-size:12px;">Eliot is currently pursuing an MFA in Composition and Experimental Sound Practices at the California Institute of the Arts.</p>
