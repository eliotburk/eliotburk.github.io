    You can listen to a demonstration of how this tuning sounds here:</p>

<p>This scordatura is constructed to be maximally dissonant, to have the same interval between each string, and to not have any extremely lose or extremely tight strings. 
    I constructed it first tuning Violin 1 in descending  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-comma_meantone" target="_blank" target="_blank">wolf fifths</a>  starting from I (tuned to E<sub>5</sub>. 
    Then tuning the Violin 2's I 65 cents flat from Violin I's I; 
    65 cents is generally perceived as the most dissonant interval (defined as auditory roughness or beating) 
    that is still audible as two distinct pitches across registers, 
    based on Paul Elrich's theory of <a href="https://en.xen.wiki/w/Harmonic_Entropy" target="_blank">Harmonic Entropy</a> and the phenomenon of <a href="https://www.math.miami.edu/~armstrong/592sp15/Plomp_Levelt_1965.pdf" target="_blank">critical band dissonance</a>. 
    The rest of Violin 2's strings are tuned in descending wolf fifths from I. 
    The Viola is tuned a wolf fifth plus 65 cents lower than Violin 2. 
    The Cello is tuned an octave and 65 cents lower than the Viola.<br><br>
    
You can actually tune this scordatura by ear pretty easily. 
  Start by tuning Violin 1's I to E<sub>5</sub>.  
    then lower the pitch of II so that it is the most dissonant sounding wide fifth you can find. 
    Tune III similarly relative to the II, and IV likewise – it'll end up half step +12 cents lower than where it usually is. 
    Tune I on Violin 2 to the most dissonant small minor second below Violin 1's I string you can find, 
    then tune the rest of Violin 2's strings with the same process as Violin 1's. 
    Tune the I string on the Viola to a slightly wide major 2nd above Violin 2's, 
    then tune the rest of the Viola's string using the same process as Violin 1's. 
    Tune the Cello's I to the most dissonant small minor 9th you can find below the Viola's I, 
    and then tune the rest of the Cello strings using the same process used for the other instruments.<br><br>

Tuning by ear this way won't give you exactly the same frequency ratios notated above, 
    but it will be very dissonant – perhaps even more dissonant for your particular ears, instruments, and room. 
    Dissonance is a subjective phenomenon after all. 
    Because of this I recommend tuning by ear rather than mechanically. 
    If you want to tune to the specific frequencies above though, you could use any tone generator.  
    I used this <a href="https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/" target="_blank">Online Tone Generator</a> by Tomasz P. Szynalski.</p>
