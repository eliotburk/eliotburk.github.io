   <p>Neither of these performances are perfect; both contain mistakes, but they should give you a general idea of the concept and shape of the piece. As you can see,
     there are significant differences between the two performances. This level of variability, or even a further departure from what I have done, is totally desirable for me.<br>
     This piece, like all my work, is a work-in-progress which will hopefully never be completed. To be finished a work is to kill it.</p>

     <h3>Basic Performance Instructions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Player 1: Violin on Viola, Player 2: Violin on Viola</li>
  <li>Lay the larger instrument on the ground face up</li>
  <li>Hold the smaller instrument face down on top of the larger instrument, strings-on-strings</li>
  <li>Rotate the the smaller instrument, starting extremely slowly and gradually accellerating until you are spinning it nearly as fast you can.</li>
  <li>While the axis of rotation can be changed to explore the various musical results of this technique, 
    it should for the most part go through the area between the bridge and fingerboard on both instruments</li>
  <li>Eventually slow down rotations to a stop.</li>
  <li>Expected duration: 2-8 minutes. It usually takes me roughly 5.</li>
</ul> 
    <p>The remainder of the score contains more detailed instructions to replicate my particular results. If you have any questions, please email me at <a href="mailto:erburk@gmail.com">erburk@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    You can listen to a demonstration of how this tuning sounds here:</p>

   <br>
<p>This scordatura is constructed to be maximally dissonant, with the same interval between each string, and to not have any extremely lose or extremely tight strings. 
    I constructed it first tuning Violin 1 in descending  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-comma_meantone" target="_blank" target="_blank">wolf fifths</a>  starting from I on E<sub>5</sub>. 
    Then tuning the Violin 2's I 65 cents flat from Violin I's I; 
    65 cents is generally perceived as the most dissonant interval (defined as auditory roughness or beating) 
    that is still audible as two distinct pitches across registers, 
    based on Paul Elrich's theory of <a href="https://en.xen.wiki/w/Harmonic_Entropy" target="_blank">Harmonic Entropy</a> and the phenomenon of <a href="https://www.math.miami.edu/~armstrong/592sp15/Plomp_Levelt_1965.pdf" target="_blank">critical band dissonance</a>. 
    The rest of Violin 2's strings are tuned in descending wolf fifths from I. 
    The Viola is tuned a wolf fifth plus 65 cents lower than Violin 2. 
    The Cello is tuned an octave and 65 cents lower than the Viola.<br><br>
    
You can actually tune this scordatura by ear pretty easily. 
  Start by tuning Violin 1's I to E<sub>5</sub>.  
    then lower the pitch of II so that it is the most dissonant sounding wide fifth you can find. 
    Tune III similarly relative to the II, and IV likewise – it'll end up half step +12 cents lower than where it usually is. 
    Tune I on Violin 2 to the most dissonant small minor 2<sup>nd</sup> below Violin 1's I string you can find, 
    then tune the rest of Violin 2's strings with the same process as Violin 1's. 
    Tune the I string on the Viola to the most dissonant small minor 2<sup>nd</sup> below Violin 2's II string you can find, 
    then tune the rest of the Viola's string using the same process as Violin 1's. 
    Tune the Cello's I to the most dissonant small minor 9<sup>th</sup> you can find below the Viola's I, 
    and then tune the rest of the Cello strings using the same process used for the other instruments.<br><br>

Tuning by ear this way won't give you exactly the same frequency ratios notated above, 
    but it will be very dissonant – perhaps even more dissonant for your particular ears, instruments, and room. 
    Dissonance is a subjective phenomenon after all. 
  Also considering the destructive techniques involved in this piece, the strings tuning will very quickly drift away from the initial tuning.
    For these reasons I recommend tuning by ear rather than mechanically. 
    If you want to tune to the specific frequencies above though, you could use a tone generator.
