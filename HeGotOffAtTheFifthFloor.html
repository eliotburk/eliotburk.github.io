The room smelled of new calfskin luggage and nail-lacquer remover.<br>

over to one of the pieces of luggage, opened it, and from under a pile of<br>
shorts and undershirts he took out an Ortgies calibre 7.65 automatic. He<br>
released the magazine, looked at it, then reinserted it. He cocked the piece.<br>
